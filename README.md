Harnessing The Power of LangChain in Healthcare Applications

LangChain can be used to build a wide variety of AI applications, including chatbots, personal assistants, creative content generators, data analysis tools, and task automation tools. If you haven't used it before, get ready to revolutionize your AI toolbox! In this session, we'll dive into the magic of creating sophisticated conversational agents by exploring the main components of LangChain: Functions and Routing which will help us build a system using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Using these components the output of this talk will culminate in not only the creation of a conversational agent in which you will fully understand the interworking and come away with the knowledge of how LangChain works, what a vector databases and embeddings are, and why it should be a critical consideration when building your AI powered products.
